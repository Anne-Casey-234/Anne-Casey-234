Computer Science Capstone,

Southern New Hampshire University,

Anne Casey. 

OVERVIEW:

This repository is a collection of my work achieved during my computer science capstone course at Southern New Hampshire University. Creating a professional repository on GitHub significantly benefits a computer science graduate, because showcasing a well-maintained repository acts as a dynamic portfolio, providing tangible evidence of my coding abilities and the projects I have worked on.Sharing my work on this platform also fosters professional networking, allowing me to connect with other developers, recieve feedback,and contribute to collaborative projects. This engagment will only enhance my professional network. While also maintaing a repository encourages continous learning and improvement, because I can revisit and refine my code, explore new technologies, and stay updated with industry trends.

Milestone One Code Review:

Code review is crucial for several reasons, primarily because it improves code quality by allowing multiple developers to examine and correct errors, bugs, and inefficiences early in the development process. This promotes knowledge sharing amongst team members, and enables junior developers to learn from their more experienced colleagues and facilitating the dessemination of best rpractices.

Milestone Two: Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

Software Design and Engineering involve the creation, development, and maintenance of software systems. Software design focuses on defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system, making high-level decisions on algorithms, data structures, and design patterns to meet requirements. This phase includes creating detailed design documents and specifications. 

Software enngineering applies engineering principles to the entire software development lifecycle, encompassing requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It aims to produce functional, reliable, scalable, and maintainable software using best practices. Together, software design and engineering ensure robust and well-architected systems that meet user needs and business goals.

Milestone Three: Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures 

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental in computer science for efficient data processing and problem-solving. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem, characterized by correctness, efficiency, and well-defined inputs and outputs. A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash table. The relationship between them is crucial, as the choice of data structure can significantly impact an algorithm's performance.

Milestone Four: Enhancement Three: Databases


Database are crucial in software engineering bacause the provide a structured and efficient way to store, retrieve, and manage data. They ensure data integrity, scalability, security, and support concurrent access by multiple users. Databases also facilitate data backup and recovery, manage relationships between data entities, and help meet regulatory requirements. They are essential for building reliable, efficient, and scalable software systems.
